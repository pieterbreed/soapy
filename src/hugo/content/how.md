## Too long; don't want to read

 1. Look at the batches that are available
 1. Decide on a price you think is fair
 1. Send me an email with those details
 1. I will arrange for payment and then delivery
 1. Enjoy soapy goodness!

## This is an experiment...

I am trying to secure my future supply of soap and figured that if I can arrange for the soap-making not to cost a fortune then my mother will continue making soap.
 
## How this works

At the moment this site is invite-only. I've emailed a few of my friends the link to this site so that they can take a look at the different batches that are available to be had.

If you are interested, please send me an email that contains the following information:

 - Which soap you would like to buy (Each batch has a name)
 - How many bars you would like to buy
 - What you want to pay for the consignment...
 
 That's right. This works on a pay-what-you-want basis. The first order of business is to see if anybody is willing to fork out cold hard cash for the product. Right now, this means a prioritization of first-come-first-served and highest-bidder.
 
 I will publish the average price for each batch so you can get an idea of how much it cost to produce. I will probably not fullfill an order for a price that I think is ridiculous, but beyond that I truly hope that you will pay a price that you consider fair.

## The fine print

Firstly. __No promises are being made for suitability__. This is home-made soap and you have to apply your mind to decide if you want to use it on your skin or not. In order to make this fair, __I don't set a price, you do__.

I am  happy to arrange a __free sample__ for you.

Lastly, if for any reason you don't like the product, please let me know and __I will refund you in full, no questions asked__. Seriously. If you think the product is not worth what you paid for it, email me and I will refund all of your money. __You don't even need to send it back__, you can keep it if you want.
