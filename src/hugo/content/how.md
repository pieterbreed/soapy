## Too long; don't want to read

 1. Look through one the batches for which I have stock (I'll link from here later, remind me if you see this)
 1. Tip me any amount that you think is fair. Any price. (I'll put a tip jar up here, remind me if you see this)
 1. [Send me an email](mailto:pieter@pb.co.za) and tell me from which batch you would like to receive one bar.
 1. I will arrange for payment and then delivery.
 1. Enjoy soapy goodness!

## This is an experiment...

...in trying to see if I can make a socially responsible business. If you need more info about this, please ask me to expand on it.
 
## The fine print

 - The soap bars weigh about __100g each__. (_maybe_ means _not-exactly_) 
 - The soap bars are __cut by hand__ (using a kitchen knife).
 - __No promises are being made for suitability__. This is home-made soap and you have to apply your mind to decide if you want to use it on your skin or not. In order to make this fair, __I don't set a price, you do__.
 - I will send your first bar for free. [Send me an email](mailto:pieter@pb.co.za) so I know who you are and where you live. I'll take care of packaging and everything.

Lastly, if __for any reason__ you don't like the product, [please let me know](mailto:pieter@pb.co.za) and __I will refund all your monies__, no questions asked. 

Seriously. If you think the product is not worth what you paid for it, I will pay all of you money back, I promise. __You don't even need to send it back to me__, you can keep it if you want...
