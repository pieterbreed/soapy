### Elza's Original Remarks

(Rooi en wit seep)
Dis 'n babaseep resep. Die seep is heerlik sag op die vel.  
Skuim lekker, al is die skuim effens bruinerig, maar dit affekteer nie die seep negatief nie.

### (My bad english translation)

This is baby soap, incredibly soft on the skin.  
It has a nice, brown-tinted foam. The tint stains the water too, although this does not affect the soap's cleaning action in a negative way.
