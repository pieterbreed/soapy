Hi Everyone! 

(At the bottom of this email I posted some lovely photos of the soap I'm going to be sending you!)

In [the last newsletter](/newsletter/what-now), I told you that I will be sending each of you 2 bars of homemade soap, each month, for the end of March, April and May. While I've been back at the office, the amazing soap factory has been hard at work preparing the soap I want to distribute in a few weeks.

> These plain and white, hand-crafted bars, are made from tallow, giving a rich foamy texture on the skin. They are unscented, but still smelling the typical deep smell of pure, natural handmade soap, made using the cold-process method.

I've asked a bunch of you for postal addresses and/or delivery addresses. [If you know I don't have yours yet, or if you are unsure whether I will remember, please send me an email with your delivery instructions. (or reply to this email)](mailto:pieter@theamazingsoapshop.co.za) 

For the people who live in Cape Town, I expect I will be driving up and down in my car (It's been 6 weeks since I've last driven my car...). Please feed me with coffee (or dinner) when I get there!

For everyone who don't live in Cape Town, I'll be sending yours by mail. I am making up my mind about the boxes I'm going to be sending the soap in and thinking a little bit about packaging and the other logistics involved in such an operation, so please bear with me while I figure some of that out. A good friend of mine volunteered to help me experiment with the packaging. Apparently _someone_ is thinking in terms of gifts already...

I can also happily report that I've been getting _really_ **exciting** reports from _the amazing soap **factory**_. The batches of soap that are busy curing sound like they smell _fantastic_. There is a batch (or two...) with _Rose_, one with _Lavendar_ and one with _Ylang Ylang_. They are _Pink_, _Turquoise_ and some other nice mixture of white and green. A little like _Green Granite._ Please click on the images below if you want to see detail. 

> That is over and above the batch of 100 _plain_ soap bars I mentioned on top that I will be getting to you at the end of March.

The _special_ soap will be made available in a _pick-and-choose_-style eCommerce website at [www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za). Lots of things still need to happen at FNB and I can only go there once my cast has been removed... I think it is safe to assume that this email newsletter will announce when the online eCommerce platform has been launched.
