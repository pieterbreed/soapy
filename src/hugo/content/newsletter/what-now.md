[If you missed it, here is the first/previous newsletter.](/newsletter/welcome)

At the end of this newsletter is a short video of me taking my first steps without crutches after the accident...

### First of all, thank you for all of the amazing ideas, suggestions and support that I've been getting from all of you.

 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **I got a decent domain name ([`www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za`](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za))**
 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **I'm using a [professionally designed layout](http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/strata/)**
 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **[Here's where I develop the brand a little by explaining what the product is about](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za/#about)**
 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **[See a colourful picture when you click on a product called *Colourful*](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za/batches/2016-01-27-3/#batch-sample-image)**
 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **[Testimonials!](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za/#testimonials)**
 - {{< fa check-square-o>}} **Vegan-friendly markers** (eg '{{< vegan >}}') I'm not vegan though, so I took my best stab at this. If I'm clearly clueless about how this works, I'd love for you to educate me properly.


### What's been going on?

I'm slowly getting to give away samples, *First come, first served*. (**Pro-tip: Invite me for dinner** if you want a sample before they're all given away. I have about 13 bars left as of `Wed Feb  3 16:11:01 SAST 2016`)

**I've ordered 75 bars op soap for the end of March!** (more on this further down)

I'm also figuring out how to talk to all of you. Chances are that I texted/whatsapped/telegrammed/messengered you the link to this document &#x1f603;
 
### "So, I hear you and I see you're excited, Pieter, but what's the plan here?" -- All of you...

Almost *everyone* wants to know what I'm planning to do here. What happens next week, when I'm back at work? What happens to this soap *shop* then?

There's no rush! Soap making takes time and I'm not in a hurry to change anything suddenly or tip over any apple cart.

But. Here's why **I can't sit still and do *nothing* either.**

### Giving someone a good bar of soap is an implicit declaration of Loving-Kindness. &#x1f499;

The gesture says, in humble ways:

 - You are worthy of *Love*.
 - You may treat yourself with *Kindness*.
 - Let me help you do that, by making this *Great* bar of soap available to *You*.

So when I am making a *business* out of *selling soap*, what I am actually doing is giving myself permission to make *that* gesture to everybody whom I care about. **All of you**. Every one of you whom I'm sending these letters to, **each one of you** are dear to me. 

### Here's my current plan

 - I just ordered **75** bars for end-of-March, **100** for end-of-April and **125** for end-of-May. (I ordered of the plain [Shea Butter recipe](/batches/29-01-2016-1/))
 - I chose a price I think is *reasonable* for two bars of soap. This amount is `R100.00`.
 - For each of you (about 25 people), I will pay this `R100.00`, three times for the months, March, April and May of 2016. 
 - For those same three months I will **send, post or throw** you **two bars** of soap, for *free*.
 - What then? We'll see.
 
### Isn't `R100.00` for **two bars** a little steep?

**No.** 

OK. Well, we'll see. `R100.00` *might* be too **cheap**, but it is definitely *excellent value*! Here's what *I'm getting* by paying that amount for *your soap*:

 - The cost for **two bars for you** is paid on your behalf.
 - There are some **equipment** that needs to be bought and **delivery expenses** to take into account too.
 - One (or maybe two) **extra bars**, is *also* paid for, on behalf of someone else.
 
Not everyone can afford `R100.00` for two bars of soap, but most of you *can*. See, **I personally know all of you!** I know who can almost afford good soap and who can afford to subsidize someone else &#x1f603;

I love many people who really cannot afford two good bars of soap every month, not at any price. So I will be taking some of the *profit* I'm making of your `R100.00` and gifting two bars to someone who cannot afford it. Because everyone is deserving of *Loving-Kindness*, not just people with *good financial circumstance*.

So why **two**? I made *that* up, honestly. &#x1f603; I'm sitting here thinking I use about two bars every month, that is probably OK for most people. If you disagree, let me know please, I'd love to hear from you.

### I can't expect any of you to do something I'm not willing to do myself though...

To kick this humble soap club off, I'm will pay this amount on your behalf for three months, as long as you **tell me** that you want to receive the soap. **I don't want to send soap to somebody who doesn't want it.**

I am going to need you all to **opt-in**. This is easy. Just **send me a message** over SMS, Whatsapp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger (whatever), and ask me to send you the soap.

That's it. **Just ask me to send you 2 bars of soap per month, for three months, and I will figure it out.** Just send me the message. Please, go ahead, do it now, I'd love to do that for you. &#x1f499;

### In my mind, you're all asking: "But maybe I would like to share this lovely soap with someone you don't know?"

As you can see for yourself from the [testimonials](/*testimonials), I have every reason to believe that you will **want to Gift** it to someone dear, once you've actually used some of the soap and realize you can make other people feel good too.

If you would like to gift somebody, who is special to you, two bars of soap, then I will gladly assist you. You pay the `R100.00` on behalf of that person and I will arrange that they get 2 bars of soap. How's that? &#x1f603;

### "Why only at the end of March?"

The process whereby the soap is made is called [Cold Process Soap Making](http://www.soap-making-resource.com/cold-process-soap-making.html)

The soap **takes about 6 weeks** (minimum) to cure properly. I've already exhausted my mother's entire stock to get enough to start giving samples away and now she needs to make some more. Like wine and people, good soap *also* needs to *sit quietly for a while* to be great.

### "When will I hear from you again?"

**Constantly**. I'll be visiting and I'll be talking to you about this, so don't worry about losing touch.

I need to create a way for you to tell me your **address to deliver your soap** to. This is something that I'll probably be doing on the website and I'll send another newsletter to announce it when it's ready.

### That's it for now. Here is a movie, taken earlier today, of me taking my first steps in 6 weeks without crutches! 

Why settle for having *a* day if you can have an *awesome* day?

[This newsletter is available online.](//www.theamazingsoapshop.co.za/newsletter/what-now)

PS -- The green-and-yellow bar in the emailed newsletter is a batch that's 'in the oven' so to speak. While I was still recovering in George, my other and I made a soft batch with Shea Butter and scented with Lavender. It's AMAZING! I also took a little cellphone video while we were making it. It contains me and my mother discussing how she makes soap, she answers some dumb-ass questions I have and we have a great time hanging out. If you would like to see that, ask me and I'll upload it to youtube &#x1f499;
