### Welcome to the inaugural The Amazing Soap Shop Newsletter!

(Ek wou hierdie nog altyd doen: Hello Ma! Sjoe! OKay, this is real!)

I kind of casually and idly spoke out loud recently. I said: "Ma, wat daarvan as ek en jy jou seep verkoop online? Ma maak die seep en ek verkoop dit?..." (Mom, what about you and I [sell your soap online](//theamazingsoapshop.co.za)?)

### (I am going to get a little wordy now.)

The back-story here is quite simple. As most of you know, I recently tore off my Achilles' tendon while out on a hike. During the next couple of hours I realized slowly that man is such a creature that he is exquisitely crafted for the business that we call Life. Then, by Grace and a little bit of woema, I arrived at a doctor that gave me a Hall Pass, permission to do nothing for 6 weeks!

For most of you this is not the first time that you hear my mother makes soap and, quite a few of you, have heard me rave about it.Well. This newsletter (the first one) is it! The trigger has been pulled on that idea. I have my Google Analytics code, I have a HotJar, an FNB Merchant Account, an actual webserver in an actual data-center at Hetzner in Johannesburg (that my buddy set up for me).

I have friends! I have family! And if I can't convince even one of you to take me up on this offer, then what kind of a friend am I to you all? :)

This is the perfect time for me start what you might call an Independent Venture :)

### What exactly am I trying to do, here?

It's simple really. I'm trying to bring balance to the supply of soap.

My mother wants to make a little more soap. She wants to have a little bit more time to experiment with the new soap-making recipes and techniques that she has found out about online.

I would like to make sure that this beautiful soap that she is making makes their way, one-by-one, bar-by-bar, into the willing, warm, soapy hands of people who would appreciate such a fine piece of human crafts-woman-ship.

I also want to generate a little extra income and have fun, while I'm doing all of this.

[The result is, The Amazing Soap Shop, an online market stall that sells home-and-hand-made, cold-process soap. This really big, really easy-to-press link will take you there if you want to check it out](//theamazingsoapshop.co.za)
 
### Why am I telling all of you this? Because! Either you...

 - took care of my while I was sick OR
 - I chatted with you a lot, while I was sick OR
 - I asked you for advice or help with this website, while I was sick OR
 - would appreciate a good story!

### and second-to-lastly, what exactly am I asking you to do for me?
 
 - Would you please visit the site, take a look around and tell me what you see? I have worked my butt of to get as far as I have, and because this is technology, everything takes longer than you would expect, especially if you're stuck inside a flat by yourself. I am working on this constantly, so if you all go together you will all send me the same feedback. It's OK if you postpone it for a few days. I'll send a follow-up email to this one, reminding you to check it out if you forget. (It's OK ðŸ˜‡)

 - I will send you two emails in the next week, and after that only one, weekly (at the most). There should be an "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of this email. I invite you to use it if you don't want more emails from me about trying to sell you soap.
Enough of you have felt how this soap feels on the body and I am sure you can attest to the fact that this is The Best Soap in the whole wide world! (on that note, I once, by accident, used a ~R500 Clinique facial soap bar on my body in the shower. This soap is awesomer than that...) The site has a feedback form that pops up once you're halfway down it. Please use it to tell me what the soap feels like to you so I can share it with others.

 - I am waiting for a bunch of things to get approved, via email, before I can enable the widget that allows me to accept online payments, but I do have a brand spanking new FNB Bizniz Account that accepts EFT payments. If you need it and I haven't somehow shared it yet, please remind me to remember to make it available.

 - There is also the yet-to-be-finalised free sample system. As it is yet to be finalized, I don't actually know how it will work, but I guess you ask me for a free sample, via email, and I post it to you.
 (If you don't like the product, I'll pay your money back, as soon as I can. Before go to bed or to lunch, I will pay your money back to you if for any reason at all, you don't like what you bought)
 
 - I also need help in determining the price. Supply is, as it always will be, severely constrained to what my mother would like to make. (I only have about 5 bars available right now) If I ask her to make too much, she will get annoyed with me. Demand, however, is completely and utterly unknown. For now, and taking into account that I know all of you personally, I'm willing to let you decide how much you want to pay. The price is completely up to you. (I will add, that while we did the calculations, we didn't find a single bar of soap that cost less than R20 to make. That's R20 per ~100g of soap bar.)
  
 - Be careful! This is home-made soap. If you do get it, test it on your hands first before you try it on your body.

Wow! OK. That might be almost it for today!
