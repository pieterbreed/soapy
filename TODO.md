# TODO

Wherein I keep note of the things I think I'll be working on. I might even remember to update this from time to time.

## enable the jarvis system to deploy to localhost with ansible

 - allow ansible to read the inventory dynamically from jarvis

## create the batches that will be sold

 - get the names in the book

## reorganize the partial hugo templates a little bit

 - remove the navigation buttons/links in the banner
 - copyright section in partial
 - single item in partials for header and footer
 
## render the old batches to, but don't link to them from the front

 - so that links can be made to batches from blog posts

## create/edit the video for the LaPiCado batch

## add support for blog posts that can link to youtube videos

## enable signup feature

 - log in via email address only
